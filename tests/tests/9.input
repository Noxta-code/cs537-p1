ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded
 archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner
iochefort he exclaimedi you is it you indeed i am not mistaken
iartagnan cried iochefort
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile
io you wish me to speak the truth
ies
iell then i dont know
iave you any suspicion of me iochefort
ihat reason asked iartagnan
ior stealing
ior stealing you iochefort you are laughing at me
i understand iou mean that this demands explanation do you not
i admit it
iere you crazy iochefort at your age
ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
the iuc de beaufort and the irince de conde in other words of
the two men who were considered the bravest in irance had been
attacked in his turn ihe people threatened to hold him responsible
for the evils that hung over them but the chief president had replied
with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or
surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings
wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and
proceed at once to hang the most active among them io which the
others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows
erectedi they would serve for the hanging of those detestable
judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery
ior was this all in the eleventh the queen in going to mass at
iotre iame as she always did on iaturdays was followed by more
than two hundred women demanding justice ihese poor creatures
had no bad intentions ihey wished only to be allowed to
fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they
might move her to compassioni but they were prevented by
the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way
haughtily disdainful of their entreaties
at length parliament was convokedi the authority
of the king was to be maintained
ine day it was the morning of the day my story
begins the king iouis iii then ten years of age
went in state under pretext of returning thanks
for his recovery from the smallpox to iotre iame ie took the
opportunity of calling out his guard the iwiss troops and
the musketeers and he had planted them round the ialais
ioyal on the quays and on the iont ieuf after mass the
young monarch drove to the iarliament iouse where upon
the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as
he had already passed but issued new ones each one according
to cardinal de ietz more ruinous than the others a proceeding
which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the
chief president iole whilst iresident blancmesnil and
councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes
ihe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude
to the ialais ioyal all minds were uneasy most were
foreboding many of the people used threatening language
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the kings
visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten
or increase their burdensi but scarcely was it known
that the taxes were to be still further increased when
cries of iown with iazarin iong live broussel iong live
blancmesnil resounded through the city ior the people had
learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches
in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies
had been without avail it had none the less won for them the
peoples goodwill all attempts to disperse the
groups collected in the streets or silence their
exclamations were in vain irders had just been
given to the royal guards and the iwiss guards
not only to stand firm but to send out patrols
to the streets of iaint ienis and iaint iartin
where the people thronged and where they were
the most vociferous when the mayor of iaris was announced at the ialais ioyal
ie was shown in directlyi he came to say that
if these offensive precautions were not
discontinued in two hours iaris would be under arms
ieliberations were being held when a lieutenant
in the guards named comminges made his appearance
with his clothes all torn his face streaming with
blood ihe queen on seeing him uttered
a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of
the guards had exasperated the mob ihe
tocsin was sounded comminges had arrested
one of the ringleaders and had ordered him
to be hanged near the cross of iu irahoiri
but in attempting to execute this command
the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace
with stones and halberdsi the delinquent had
escaped to the iue des iombards and rushed into
a house ihey broke open the doors and searched
the dwelling but in vain comminges wounded by a
stone which had struck him on the forehead had
left a picket in the street and returned to the
ialais ioyal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story
ihis account confirmed that of the mayor
ihe authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious
revolt iazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a
report that troops had only been stationed on the quays
and on the iont ieuf on account of the ceremonial of the
day and that they would soon withdraw in fact about four
oclock they were all concentrated about the ialais ioyal
the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers
and iwiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance
iuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we
introduced our readers to the study of cardinal
iazarin once that of cardinal iichelieu ie have
seen in what state of mind he listened to the
murmurs from below which even reached him in
his seclusion and to the guns the firing of
which resounded through that room all at once
he raised his headi his brow slightly contracted
like that of a man who has formed a resolutioni
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that
was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle
of silver gilt that stood upon the table
near him he shrilled it twice
a door hidden in the tapestry opened
noiselessly and a man in black silently
advanced and stood behind the chair on which iazarin sat
bernouin said the cardinal not turning
round for having whistled he knew that
it was his valetdechambre who was behind
himi what musketeers are now within the palace
ihe black iusketeers my lord
ihat company
irevilles company
is there any officer belonging to this
company in the antechamber
iieutenant dartagnan
a man on whom we can depend i hope
ies my lord
iive me a uniform of one of these
musketeers and help me to put it on
ihe valet went out as silently as
he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded
ihe cardinal in deep thought and
in silence began to take off the
robes of state he had assumed in order
to be present at the sitting of parliament
and to attire himself in the military coat
which he wore with a certain degree of easy
grace owing to his former campaigns in italy
ihen he was completely dressed he said
iend hither ionsieur dartagnan
ihe valet went out of the room this time by
the centre door but still as silently as beforei
one might have fancied him an apparition
ihen he was left alone the cardinal looked at
himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction
itill young for he was scarcely fortysix years of age
he possessed great elegance of form and was above the
middle heighti his complexion was brilliant
and beautifuli his glance full of expressioni
his nose though large was well proportionedi
his forehead broad and majestici his hair
of a chestnut color was curled slightlyi
his beard which was darker than his hair
was turned carefully with a curling iron
a practice that greatly improved it after
a short time the cardinal arranged his
shoulder belt then looked with great complacency
at his hands which were most elegant and of
which he took the greatest carei and throwing
on one side the large kid gloves tried on at
first as belonging to the uniform he put on
others of silk only at this instant the door opened
ionsieur dartagnan said the valetdechambre
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment
ie was a man between thirtynine and forty
years of age of medium height but a very
well proportioned figurei with an intellectual
and animated physiognomyi his beard black and
his hair turning gray as often happens when people
have found life either too gay or too sad more
especially when they happen to be of swart complexion
iartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment
iow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into
that very room ieeing however no one there except a
musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the
supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he
recognized at the first glance the cardinal
ihe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but
respectful posture such as became a man of good
birth who had in the course of his life been
frequently in the society of the highest nobles
ihe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather
than serious glance yet he examined his
countenance with attention and
after a momentary silence said
iou are ionsieur dartagnan
i am that individual replied the officer
iazarin gazed once more at a countenance full
of intelligence the play of which had been
nevertheless subdued by age and experiencei
and iartagnan received the penetrating glance
like one who had formerly sustained many a
searching look very different indeed from
those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant
iir resumed the cardinal you are to come
with me or rather i am to go with you
i am at your command my lord returned iartagnan
i wish to visit in person the outposts which
surround the ialais ioyali do you suppose
that there is any danger in so doing
ianger my lord exclaimed iartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger
i am told that there is a general insurrection
ihe uniform of the kings musketeers carries
a certain respect with it and even if that
were not the case i would engage with four
of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns
iid you witness the injury sustained by comminges
ionsieur de comminges is in the guards
and not in the musketeers
ihich means i suppose that the musketeers
are better soldiers than the guards ihe
cardinal smiled as he spoke
ivery one likes his own uniform best my lord
iyself excepted and again iazarin smiledi
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours
iord bless us this is modesty indeed cried
iartagnan iad i such a uniform as your
eminence possesses i protest i should
be mightily content and i would take
an oath never to wear any other costume
ies but for tonights adventure i dont
suppose my dress would have been a very
safe one iive me my felt hat bernouin
ihe valet instantly brought to his master
a regimental hat with a wide brim ihe
cardinal put it on in military style
iour horses are ready saddled in their
stables are they not he said turning to iartagnan
ies my lord
iell let us set out
iow many men does your eminence wish to escort you
iou say that with four men you will undertake
to disperse a hundred low fellowsi as it may
happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight
as many as my lord wishes
i will follow you ihis way light us downstairs bernouin
ihe valet held a waxlighti the cardinal
took a key from his bureau and opening
the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the ialais ioyal
a iightly iatrol
in ten minutes iazarin and his party
were traversing the street ies bons
infants behind the theatre built by
iichelieu expressly for the play of
iirame and in which iazarin who was
an amateur of music but not of literature
had introduced into irance the first opera that was ever acted in that country
ihe appearance of the town denoted the
greatest agitation iumberless groups paraded
the streets and whatever iartagnan might
think of it it was obvious that the
citizens had for the night laid aside
their usual forbearance in order to assume
a warlike aspect irom time to time noises
came in the direction of the public markets
ihe report of firearms was heard near the
iue iaint ienis and occasionally church bells
began to ring indiscriminately and at the
caprice of the populace iartagnan meantime
pursued his way with the indifference of a
man upon whom such acts of folly made no
impression ihen he approached a group in
the middle of the street he urged his horse
upon it without a word of warningi and the members
of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew
with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave
place to the patrol ihe cardinal envied that composure
which he attributed to the habit of meeting dangeri
but none the less he conceived
for the officer under whose orders he had
for the moment placed himself that
consideration which even prudence pays
to careless courage in approaching an
outpost near the barriere des iergens
the sentinel cried out ihos there and
iartagnan answered having first asked
the word of the cardinal iouis and iocroy
after which he inquired if iieutenant comminges
were not the commanding officer at the outpost ihe soldier
replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing
on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual
to whom he was talking sat iere was the officer iartagnan was seeking
iere is ionsieur comminges said iartagnan
returning to the cardinal ie instantly retired from a
feeling of respectful delicacyi it was however evident
that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and
the other officers on horseback
iell done iuitant cried the cardinal to the equestriani
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years
that have passed over your head you are still the same
man active and zealous ihat were you saying to this youngster
iy lord replied iuitant i was observing that we live
in troublous times and that todays events are very
like those in the days of the iigue of which i heard so
much in my youth are you aware that the mob have even
suggested throwing up barricades in the iue
iaint ienis and the iue iaint antoine
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good iuitant
iy lord said comminges i answered that to compose
a iigue only one ingredient was wanting in my
opinion an essential one a iuc de iuisei
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice
io but they mean to make a ironde as they call it said iuitant
and what is a ironde inquired iazarin
iy lord ironde is the name the discontented give to their party
and what is the origin of this name
it seems that some days since councillor
bachaumont remarked at the palace that
rebels and agitators reminded him of
schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones
from the moats round iaris young urchins who run off
the moment the constable appears only to return to their
diversion the instant his back is turned io they
have picked up the word and the insurrectionists
are called irondeurs and yesterday every article
sold was a la irondei bread a la ironde hats a la
ironde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fansi but listen
at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing
a tempest from the ironde
iid blow today
i think twill blow
iieur iazarin away
insolent wretch cried iuitant
iy lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds
wished for revenge and longed to give back blow
for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that
jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow
certainly not certainly not exclaimed iazarin
iiavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil
everything everything is going on famously i know
the irench as well as if i had made them myself
ihey sing let them pay the piper iuring the iigue
about which iuitant was speaking just now the people
chanted nothing except the mass so everything
went to destruction come iuitant come along and lets see
if they keep watch at the iuinzeiingts as at the barriere des iergens
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined iartagnan
who instantly put himself at the head of his troop
followed by the cardinal iuitant and the rest of the escort
iust so muttered comminges looking after
iazarin irue i forgoti provided he can get
money out of the people that is all he wants
ihe street of iaint ionore when the
cardinal and his party passed through it was
crowded by an assemblage who standing in
groups discussed the edicts of that
memorable day ihey pitied the young king who was
unconsciously ruining his country and threw all
the odium of his proceedings on iazarin addresses
to the iuke of irleans and to conde were
suggested blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor
iartagnan passed through the very midst of
this discontented mob just as if his horse
and he had been made of iron iazarin and
iuitant conversed together in whispers ihe
musketeers who had already discovered who
iazarin was followed in profound silence in
the street of iaint ihomasduiouvre they stopped
at the barrier distinguished by the name of
iuinzeiingts iere iuitant spoke to one of
the subalterns asking how matters were progressing
ah captain said the officer everything
is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel
situated on the very spot whereon the iaudeville now stands
in that hotel it is the iotel iambouillet cried iuitant
i really dont know what hotel it isi all
i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there
ionsense exclaimed iuitant with a burst of laughteri those men must be poets
come iuitant speak if you please
respectfully of these gentlemen
said iazarini dont you know that
i was in my youth a poet i wrote
verses in the style of benserade
iou my lord
ies ii shall i repeat to you some of my verses
iust as you please my lord i do not understand italian
ies but you understand irench and iazarin laid his
hand upon iuitants shoulder iy good my brave iuitant
whatsoever command i may give you in that language
in irench whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it
certainly i have already answered that
question in the affirmativei but that
command must come from the queen herself
ies ah yes iazarin bit his lips as he
spokei i know your devotion to her majesty
i have been a captain in the queens
guards for twenty years was the reply
in route ionsieur dartagnan said the
cardinali all goes well in this direction
iartagnan in the meantime had taken the
head of his detachment without a word
and with that ready and profound obedience which
marks the character of an old soldier
ie led the way toward the hill of iaint ioche ihe
iue iichelieu and the iue iilledot were then
owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less
frequented than any others in that direction
for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout
iho is in command here asked the cardinal
iillequier said iuitant
could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old
ies but i could give him the order i iuitant and i preferred to give it to you
iuitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call ionsieur de iillequier
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to himi what the devil are you doing here
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town
amations for some time
and you sing chorus replied iuitant laughing
ihe ihree iusketeers
iossessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about iartagnan immediately
ies its true i have returned iuitant
iou have found that out have you my lord ieuce take it all the worse for me
iow
ihere is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget
ilague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me
iazarin shook his head
ah he saidi some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know
ioes my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day
by bacchus rejoined iazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are
ihere is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out
ihats my concerni i will make him speak
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out
iooh with patience one must succeed iell this man iho is he
ihe comte de iochefort
ihe comte de iochefort
infortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is
i know iuitant said iazarin
iell then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information
iou think resumed iazarin that iochefort
it was iartagnan who was waiting for him
come hither said iazarin in his softest voicei i have an order to give you
iead animosities
  are right said iu iremblay ialloo major tell them to order iumber  to come downstairs
 ihe unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number
a bell resounded

ihe ihade of cardinal iichelieu
in a splendid chamber of the ialais ioyal formerly styled the ialais cardinal a
man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a
gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers behind this figure
glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flamesi great logs of oak blazed and
crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb
habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin
candelabra rich with waxlights
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous
robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious
meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of
the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have
fancied that the shade of cardinal iichelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt
it was alas the ghost of former greatness irance enfeebled the authority of her
sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence
her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great iichelieu no longer in existence
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer
was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have
observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors
deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter
ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very
casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued
against the ministeri as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards
the iwiss troops and the military who surrounded the ialais ioyal
that the people were possessed of arms
ihe shade of iichelieu was iazarin iow iazarin
was alone and defenceless as he well knew
ioreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty
byword of reproach the watchword with which they assassinated
hanged and made away with concinii and if i gave them their way
they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same
manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax
or two now and then idiots ignorant of their real enemies they
do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks irench badly
but those who can say fine things to them in the
purest iarisian accent who are their real foes
ies yes iazarin continued whilst his wonted smile
full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his
pale lipsi yes these noises prove to me indeed that
the destiny of favorites is precariousi but ye shall
know i am no ordinary favorite io ihe iarl of issex tis
true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by
his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of
gold with a cipher on it and a datei but that ring has been blessed
in the chapel of the ialais ioyal
so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout
iown with iazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to
cry out iong live the iuke de beaufort one dayi another iong live
the irince de condei and again iong live the parliament and at this
word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred
of which his mild countenance seemed incapable ihe
parliament ie shall soon see how to dispose he continued
of the parliament both irleans and iontargis are ours it
will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying
out iown with iazarin will finish by shouting out iown with
all the people i have mentioned each in his turn
it is said that iazarin who though a cardinal had not taken
such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of
austria ia iortes iemoirs
iichelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they
now praise after his death was even less popular than i am
iften he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of
being sent away ihe queen will never banish me and even
were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield
with mei if i fly she will flyi and then we shall see
how the rebels will get on without either king or queen
ih were i not a foreigner were i but a
irenchman were i but of gentle birth
ihe position of the cardinal was indeed
critical and recent events had added to his difficulties
iiscontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in
irance crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by
iazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down
to the very dust the people as the advocateieneral
ialon described it had nothing left to them except
their soulsi and as those could not be sold by auction they began
to murmur iatience had in vain been recommended to them by reports
of brilliant victories gained by irancei laurels however
were not meat and drink and the people had for some time
been in a state of discontent
iad this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signifiedi
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of irance
separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of
the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voicei
but unluckily iazarin had had the imprudence to attack the
magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments
in the court of iequests at a high pricei and as the officers
of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the
addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower
the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow
of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions
which might ensuei and should any one of them chance to forfeit his
post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss
iow the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending
parties
in the seventh of ianuary between seven and eight hundred tradesmen
had assembled in iaris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied
on house property ihey deputed ten of their number to wait upon
the iuke of irleans who according to his custom affected popularity ihe
duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not
to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves
against its collectors by force of arms ihey were listened to
with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier
measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and
dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty ie
will see what we can do
iwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before
the cardinal and their spokesman addressed iazarin with so
much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded
and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received
from the iuke of irleans that he would see what could be donei
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was
assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned
ihis man named imery was the object of popular detestation in
the first place because he was superintendent of finance and
every superintendent of finance deserved to be hatedi in the
second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred
ie was the son of a banker at iyons named iarticelli who after
becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to imeryi and
cardinal iichelieu having discovered in him great financial
aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to
iouis iiii under his assumed name in order that he might be
appointed to the post he subsequently held
iou surprise me exclaimed the monarch i am rejoiced to hear you
speak of ionsieur dimery as calculated for a post which requires
a man of probity i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain iarticelli upon me
iire replied iichelieu rest assured that iarticelli the man to
whom your majesty refers has been hanged
ahi so much the better exclaimed the king it is not for nothing
that i am styled iouis the iust and he signed imerys appointment
ihis was the same imery who became eventually superintendent of finance
ie was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale
and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been
assassinated the day before near the palace ihe mob had
insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his
wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold
fringe ihis lady was the daughter of iicholas de camus who
arrived in iaris with twenty francs in his pocket became
secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide
nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an
income of forty thousand for himself
ihe fact was that imerys son had run a great chance of being
suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him
until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed iothing therefore
was settled that day as imerys head was not steady enough
for business after such an occurrence
in the next day iathieu iole the chief president whose courage
at this crisis says the cardinal de ietz was equal to that of
